         <p>A flower is sometimes known as a bloom or blossom. Flowers are the reproductive organs of a plant. They mediate the joining of the sperm, contained within pollen, to the ovules contained in the ovary. The four main parts of a flower are usually defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by their function.</p>

         <p>succulent, any plant with thick fleshy tissues adapted to water storage. Some succulents (e.g., cacti) store water only in the stem and have no leaves or very small leaves, whereas others (e.g., agaves) store water mainly in the leaves. Most succulents have deep or broad root systems and are native to either deserts or regions that have a semiarid season. Succulent plants are found in more than 60 plant families, with members of Aizoaceae, Cactaceae, and Crassulaceae being dominantly succulent. A number are cultivated as ornamentals and houseplants, including Aloe, Echeveria, Kalanchoe, and others.</p>

Often this will mean the foliage is blotched, striped, or bordered with a lighter color than that on the rest of it (or vice versa).</p>
