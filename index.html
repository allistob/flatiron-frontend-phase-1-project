       <div class="content">
         <p>A flower is sometimes known as a bloom or blossom. Flowers are the reproductive organs of a plant. They mediate the joining of the sperm, contained within pollen, to the ovules contained in the ovary. The four main parts of a flower are usually defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by their function.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">ORCHIDS</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Orchids are plants that belong to the family Orchidaceae, a diverse and widespread group of flowering plants with blooms that are often colourful and fragrant. Orchidaceae is one of the two largest families of flowering plants, along with the Asteraceae. Orchids should be watered once a week on average. These plants require very little water, which is why you'll often see orchid lovers using an ice cube rather than a watering can. Place a large ice cube at the plant's base and allow it to melt. That will provide the plant with a steady stream of water that won't overwhelm its delicate root system.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">TULIPS</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Origins in Central Asia: Tulips are often associated with the Netherlands, but their origins can be traced back to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the areas around Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. They were first cultivated by the Ottoman Empire and later brought to Europe in the 16th century. ulip petals are edible and have been used in various cuisines, especially in the Middle East and Central Asia. They can be added to salads or used as a garnish. However, not all tulip species are edible, so caution must be exercised. Beyond their popularity in art and culture, tulips have been used as symbols in various contexts. For instance, during World War II, the Dutch royal family's coat of arms featured a tulip, and it was used as a sign of resistance against the Nazi occupation.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">SUN FLOWER</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine, where it holds significant cultural and historical importance. The iconic sunflower "flower" is actually composed of many small individual flowers called florets. The yellow "petals" are actually ray florets, and the dark center is made up of disc florets, which will eventually turn into seeds. Some Native American tribes used sunflowers for medicinal purposes. The seeds were used as a remedy for snake bites, and a poultice made from the crushed leaves was applied to wounds. Sunflowers are associated with various symbolic meanings. They often represent adoration, loyalty, and longevity. In some cultures, they are considered a symbol of positivity and good luck. One of the most fascinating features of sunflowers is their heliotropism, which means they exhibit a behavior known as "solar tracking." During their growth stages, young sunflowers face east in the morning and follow the sun as it moves across the sky throughout the day, eventually facing west in the evening. This movement is most prominent in young sunflowers and becomes less pronounced as they mature.</p>

       <div class="content">
         <p>succulent, any plant with thick fleshy tissues adapted to water storage. Some succulents (e.g., cacti) store water only in the stem and have no leaves or very small leaves, whereas others (e.g., agaves) store water mainly in the leaves. Most succulents have deep or broad root systems and are native to either deserts or regions that have a semiarid season. Succulent plants are found in more than 60 plant families, with members of Aizoaceae, Cactaceae, and Crassulaceae being dominantly succulent. A number are cultivated as ornamentals and houseplants, including Aloe, Echeveria, Kalanchoe, and others.</p>
